### Why you must learn Java 

 - wide usages (Web-apps, backend, Mobile apps, enterprise software).
 - One of the most popular language.
 - High paying and a lot of job.
 - Object Oriented.
 - Rich APIs and Community Support.

### What is a Programming Language

---

:- Compiler converts high level languages to low level language machine code.

- Giving instruction to a computer.
- Instruction : Tells computer what to do.
- These instructions are called code.
- Human instruction are given in High level languages.

### What is an Algorithm

---
:- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem and performing a task.

### What is Syntax ?

---

:- Structure of words in a sentence. 

- it is depend on language (cpp,java,perl,javascrript).
- For programming exact Syntax must be followed.

### History of Java

---

:- Developed by *James Gosling* at Sun Microsystems(Early 1990s).

- Originally named 'Oak', later renamed java, in 1995.
- First Release (1995)
- "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
- Developed with vision of backward compatibility.

### Magic of Byte Code.

---

- Source -> compiler -> Byte code -> Virtual machine

### Java Buzzwords

# â˜• Java Buzzwords

Java is known for several important features that make it a powerful and popular programming language. These features are often called **Java Buzzwords**.

## ðŸ”‘ List of Java Buzzwords

1. **Simple**  
   Java is easy to learn and use. Its syntax is clean and closely related to C++, but with fewer complexities.

2. **Object-Oriented**  
   Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm. Everything is treated as an object, which enhances modularity and reusability.

3. **Platform-Independent**  
   Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes it truly "Write Once, Run Anywhere".

4. **Secure**  
   Java provides a secure runtime environment through features like bytecode verification, sandboxing, and security APIs.

5. **Robust**  
   Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking mechanisms, which make it reliable and crash-resistant.

6. **Multithreaded**  
   Java supports multithreading, allowing you to write programs that perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

7. **Architecture-Neutral**  
   Java bytecode is not dependent on any particular hardware, making it architecture-neutral.

8. **Portable**  
   Java programs are portable across platforms because they donâ€™t depend on system-specific features.

9. **High Performance**  
   Java performance is enhanced with technologies like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that convert bytecode into native machine code at runtime.

10. **Distributed**  
    Java makes it easy to create distributed applications using features like Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and sockets.

11. **Dynamic**  
    Java can adapt to an evolving environment by dynamically loading classes and supporting runtime polymorphism.

12. **Interpreted**  
    Java bytecode is interpreted by the JVM, which adds to its portability and flexibility.
